,XIGMATEK Gaia SD1283 CPU Cooler,"Gaia, adopted from Gaia the mother of earth, a goddess in Greek religion, the creator of all. This innovative and powerful cooler maintains your CPU at a stable low temperature.<br /><br />

<strong>-Stable cool climate delivered to your CPU by the goddess herself.</strong><br />
We envisioned the Gaia to be just like mother earth, with the vision 
of creating a silent yet effective cooling environment for the CPU that 
reflects a peaceful rainforest ambience. Our engineers here at Xigmatek 
needed to acquire a way to deliver the same remarkable effectiveness but
 with the aim of generating minimal sound pollution to simulate calm 
tranquilized surrounding.<br /><br />

<strong>-We didn’t want to bring you just a cooler, We
wanted to bring you an extraordinary cooler.</strong><br />
Our team of highly experienced thermal engineers came up with an idea
 of inventing a more effective process to displace heat. We call this 
Heat-pipe Direct Touch Technology. To achieve this innovation we needed 
to reinvent the entire traditional cooper / aluminum heat-sink base. HDT
 works by integrating the cooper heat-pipes straight to your CPU giving a
 direct touch. After excessive experiments through trial and error, we are proud to announce our HDT 
technology produces over 10 percent more heat conductivity compared to 
the traditional cooper heat-sinks and a colossal 170 percent improvement
 over the aluminum heat-sink most commonly
found in retail coolers. This innovation will deliver up to an 
astronomical 45 percent in heat displacement.<br /><br />

<strong>-Being first in the world to accomplish this is one of our greatest achievements</strong><br />
The Gaia is designed with a remarkable fin
shape resembling an X which creates maximum aerodynamic airflow. The material
is made from the finest aluminum, crafted with care and precision and
engineered to the finest detail maximizing thermal heat displacement. Unlike
other fan connectors - we innovate beyond
imagination. To insure a stable connection for our highly competent fan,
our engineers needed to reinvent the connector. Instead of using a stainless
steel clip, we decided that by using a rubber fabrication it would eliminate unnecessary
vibrations, ultimately delivering close to nonexistent sound.<br /><br />

Cooling a CPU has two major aspects, firstly
the thermal displacement from the heat-sink / fins and secondly the fan. Obviously
the higher the RPM of the fan rotation, the more effective the heat can be
driven away. Our intention was not only to design a powerful fan - we wanted to
construct a fan which had an exceedingly long life expectancy. We are proud to
say we accomplished this with our newly redesigned innovative F.C.B
